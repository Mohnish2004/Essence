# Features

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Uncover the sentiment behind your text and gain valuable insights. Enter the text you want to analyze, and Essence will reveal the emotions within. The app uses both the TextBlob and VaderSentiment libraries to provide sentiment scores and labels.

### 2. Sentiment Annotations
Experience the sentiment of each word in your text. Essence provides a visually annotated representation of your text, highlighting positive, negative, and neutral words with distinct colors.

### 3. Token Sentiment Analysis
Delve deeper into token-level sentiment analysis. Essence can break down your text into individual words and analyze their sentiment scores. You'll get a breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral tokens.

### 4. Word Cloud Generation
Visualize the most frequent words in your text using a word cloud. Essence generates stunning word clouds to help you understand the prominent themes and topics in your text data. The word cloud feature is available for English text.

# New Ideas for Future Updates

We're constantly looking to improve Essence and enhance its capabilities. Here are some ideas for future updates:

### 1. Multilingual Support
Extend the word cloud feature to support multiple languages, allowing users to generate word clouds for text in various languages.

Give users the ability to customize the appearance of sentiment annotations, word clouds, and other visualizations according to their preferences.

### 3. Entity Recognition
Incorporate named entity recognition to identify and highlight entities such as names, places, organizations, and more in the text.

### 4. Advanced Language Detection
Enhance the language detection algorithm to accurately identify the language of the text, enabling better support for various languages.

### 5. User Accounts and Text History
Implement user accounts to allow users to save and revisit their analyzed texts, creating a history of analyzed content.

### 6. Sentiment Trends
Provide users with insights into sentiment trends over time, enabling them to track changes in sentiment for specific texts or topics.

### 7. Integration with Data Sources
Enable users to import text data from various sources such as social media platforms, documents, and more for seamless analysis.
